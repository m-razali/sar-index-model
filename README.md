QGIS Tool to calculate some Sentinel-1 Spectral Indices, namely:
1. Radar Vegetation Index(RVI)
2. Polarization Ratio (PR)
3. Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Water Index (SDWI)
4. Radar Forest Degradation Index(RFDI)
5. Normalized Difference Polarization Index(NDPol)
6. Dual-polarized Radar Vegetation Index(DpRVI)

This tool uses Sentinel-1 RTC data
